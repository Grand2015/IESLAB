# Leakage-simulation
This procedure is mainly intended to achieve transient simulation of leakage.</br>
But this is a failure experiment, as long as the reason is EPANET software will be removed from the transient signal.</br>
This procedure includes the Matlab program and EPANET program in two parts.</br>
