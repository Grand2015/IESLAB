# Burst Detection
This procedure is mainly burst detection</br>
Mainly combined with Zhao Dandan's normal distribution of the cumulative probability of the inflection point method and Hong Jia Ming brothers SPC method</br>
The SCADA data of SX city water supply network are analyzed effectively</br>
Current progress:</br>

1. Get the IDs of 14 monitoring points;</br>
2. Combing the pressure data of the four monitoring points on April 2 and judging whether the normal distribution</br>
3. save the data</br>



1. The normal distribution probability curve has been completed</br>
2. add SX SCADA Data</br>
